file: incoming_message.ets

dependencies:

  - CoapMethod and OptionName from 'coap-packet'                Both Done 
  - AddressInfo from 'net'                                      Done   
  - Readable and ReadableOptions from 'readable-stream'         Not Done 
            Readable is fairly large -> should we implement it as another library?
            Dependable on the 'Buffer' library from nodejs



file: outgoing_message.ets

dependencies:

  - Packet and OptionName from 'coap-packet'                
            Both Done but Packet' needs interface of 'Buffer'
  - BufferList from 'bl' -> Requires Buffer                     bl implemented


implemented dependencies:
  - BufferList from 'bl'
  - CoapMethod, OptionName and Packet from 'coap-packet'
  - AddressInfo and isIPv6 from 'net'
  - inherits from 'util.inherits'  => used in bl 
  - capitalize 


Missing dependencies:
  - 'buffer'

  dependencies I can port:

    - 'readable-stream'
      https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream
      Very Large. Will take alot of time to convert in Typescript.
